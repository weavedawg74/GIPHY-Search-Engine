# Giphy-Search-Engine-Website

## Project: 
Website With a Search Engine

## Overview:
Design a search engine using an API to communicate from my page to an external source. The user will put in their desired search term, and the first 15 results will be displayed on the website.

## Requirements:

### User Stories:
- As a social media user I want to easily search gifs on the web and have them displayed in a large format so that I can better view them.
- As a gamer I want a tool that allows me to easily search for gifs and opens them in a new window so that I can easily view the links.
- As a mobile phone user I want to search for gifs using a tool that will open the gif in a seperate window so that I can copy and paste the gif into my messenger app.

### Future improvements:

I haven't fully mastered creating a responsive website, but through using and better understanding Bootstrap I do feel that I'm much closer to fully understanding and embracing the "mobile first" concept of development.
